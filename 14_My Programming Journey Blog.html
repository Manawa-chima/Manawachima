        <h2>My First Steps in Programming</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 20, 2024</p>
        <p>Today marks the beginning of my journey into the world of programming. I've always been fascinated by technology and how things work, and I decided to take the first step by learning the basics of programming. It's a bit overwhelming at first, but I'm excited to see where this path will lead me.</p>
        <p>I started with some introductory tutorials on Python, as it is a beginner-friendly language. I'm still wrapping my head around concepts like variables, loops, and conditional statements, but I'm determined to get better every day.</p>

        <h2>Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> Septemberer 24, 2024</p>
        <p>After getting comfortable with Python basics, I decided to dive into web development with HTML and CSS. I learned how to create web pages and style them to make them visually appealing. It's amazing how just a few lines of code can make such a big difference in the design of a website.</p>
        <p>In this entry, I experimented with different HTML tags and CSS properties like colors, fonts, margins, and paddings. I even created a small webpage to practice my new skills, and I can't wait to build more complex websites in the future.</p>

        <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 5, 2024</p>
        <p>After getting comfortable with HTML and CSS basics, I decided to dive into web development with UI/UX Design. I learned how to create profile and wire-frameing style to make them visually appealing. It's amazing how it make a big difference in the design of a website.</p>
        <p>In this entry, I experimented with different UI/UX Design properties like colors, layout and font. And I can't wait to build more complex websites in the future.</p>
